Nianlong Li is an Associate Professor at the Beijing Key Laboratory of Human-Computer Interaction, [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences (ISCAS)](http://www.iscas.ac.cn/), and is supported by the *Hundred Talents Plan of Chinese Academy of Sciences*. Prior to joining ISCAS, Nianlong was a researcher at Lenovo Research, where he contributed to core interaction technologies and platforms for the company' s glasses-free 3D product line. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS)](https://www.ucas.ac.cn/) in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. [Feng Tian](http://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~fengt/) and Prof. [Teng Han](http://teng-han.com/). 

Nianlong's research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), with a particular emphasis on *spatial interaction paradigms for 3D interfaces and embodied intelligent agents*. His research interests include: 1) Modeling human behaviors to uncover interaction mechanisms; 2) Optimizing devices and multimodal techniques to improve task efficiency; 3) Transferring user abilities to agents to advance human-machine collaboration.
