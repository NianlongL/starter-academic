abstract: "Interactive systems with dynamic content are becoming ubiquitous nowadays. However, it is challenging to select small and fast-moving targets in such environment. We present 2D-BayesPointer, a novel interaction technique to assist moving target selection in 2D space. Compared with previous techniques, our method provides implicit support without modifying the original interface design. Moreover, the algorithmic parameters are determined by probabilistic modeling of human performance in moving target selection tasks. The preliminary results from a pilot study have shown that this technique can significantly improve both selection speed and accuracy."
