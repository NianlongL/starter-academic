abstract: "This work presents Dual-Stick, a novel controller with two sticks connected at the end that innovates a Dual-Ray interaction paradigm to enrich raycasting input in Virtual Reality (VR). Dual-Stick leverages the inherent human dexterity in using everyday tools such as clamps and tweezers to adjust the relative angle between two sticks. This design supports Dual-Ray interactions that provide with a heuristics-based enhanced mechanism. It also offers more flexible manipulation by taking advantages of additional degrees of freedom provided by clamping angle. We conducted two studies to evaluate the effectiveness of Dual-Ray in target selection and manipulation tasks. The results indicated that Dual-Ray significantly improved efficiency in target selection compared to single-ray input but did not outperform the enhanced single-ray technique. In terms of manipulation, Dual-Ray effectively reduced completion time and mode switching compared to single-ray input."
